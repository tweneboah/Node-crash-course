The Node.js Text File Word Counter

This is a sample text file to test our word counter application. This file contains multiple paragraphs, lines, and words that will help us verify the accuracy of our counting functions.

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.


This sample text contains words that repeat, like Node.js, JavaScript, and file, which will help us test the common word counting functionality. File operations are common in Node.js applications. JavaScript is a versatile language that works well with Node.js for various development tasks.

The end of our sample text file is here. This should provide enough data to test our word counting application thoroughly.
